He came to a door flanked by two security guards and looked into the retina scanner. The lock disengaged, and he entered a large room with a floor that sloped down from the back.\par \tab The room reminded Tony of the }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid13851710 Apollo}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid13851710 -era Mission Control Center in Houston. He\rquote d been a kid in the 1960s, and had thought that was just about the coolest place ever. Years later, he\rquote d visited it; the room was preserved as a historic site, although the ashtrays had been removed lest they set a bad example for the schoolkids peering in from the observation gallery at the rear.\par \tab Tony had been surprised on that trip. The windowless room had always seemed subterranean to him, but it turned out to be on the second floor\emdash to protect it from flooding, he\rquote d learned, should a hurricane hit.\par \tab The facility he\rquote d just entered was even higher up, on the twentieth floor of an office tower in Alexandria, Virginia. It contained four rows of workstations, each with five analysts. The stations in the first row were known as the \u8220\'d2hot seats,\u8221\'d3 and were manned by experts dealing with the highest-priority threat, which, right now, was the China situation. Tony had his own station at the right side of the back row, where he could watch over everyone.\par \tab All the workstations had large freestanding LCDs instead of Houston\rquote s console-mounted CRTs. Shelton Halleck\rquote s was the middle position in the third row. Tony sidled along until he was standing behind Shel, a white man two decades younger than himself with broad shoulders and black hair.\par \tab The room\rquote s front wall contained three giant screens, each of which could be slaved to any analysts\rquote  LCD. Above the right-hand monitor was the WATCH logo\emdash an eye with a globe of the Earth for the iris\emdash and the division\rquote s full name spelled out beneath: Web Activity Threat Containment Headquarters. Above the left was the circular seal of WATCH\rquote s parent organization, the National Security Agency; it depicted a bald eagle holding an old-fashioned key in its talons.\par \tab Neither part of Tony\rquote s bifocals was suitable for reading Shelton\rquote s screen from this distance, so he reached over and touched the button that copied its contents to the middle of the wall-mounted monitors. The active window was a hex dump\emdash and one hex dump looked pretty much like any other. This one happened to begin 04 BF 8C 00 02 C9. \u8220\'d2What is it?\u8221\'d3 Tony asked.\par \tab \u8220\'d2Visual data,\u8221\'d3 replied Shel. He had his shirt sleeves rolled up. There was a tattoo of a snake coiling around his left forearm. \u8220\'d2But it\rquote s not encoded in any standard format.\u8221\'d3\par \tab \u8220\'d2How do you know it\rquote s visual, then?\u8221\'d3\par \tab \u8220\'d2Sorry,\u8221\'d3 said Shel. \u8220\'d2I should have said it\rquote s not encoded in any standard }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid13851710 computer}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid13851710  format.

Another window came to the foreground on the center monitor, and\emdash Tony glanced down quickly to confirm it\emdash on Shel\rquote s own monitor, too. It was a PDF of a journal article entitled \u8220\'d2Nature\rquote s Codec: Data Encoding and Compression Schemes in Human Retinal Signaling.\u8221\'d3 The authors were listed as Masayuki Kuroda and Hiroshi Okawa.\par \tab }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid13851710 \u8220\'d2Human}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid13851710  vision?\u8221\'d3 said Tony, surprised.\par \tab Shel spoke without looking back at him. \u8220\'d2That\rquote s right, and in real time.\u8221\'d3\par \tab \u8220\'d2Human vision\~... on the Web?

Up in Canada, right?\u8221\'d3\par \tab Shel nodded. \u8220\'d2Except she\rquote s actually an American.\u8221\'d3\par \tab \u8220\'d2And it\rquote s her visual signals that are being sent over the net?\u8221\'d3\par \tab \u8220\'d2Almost certainly,\u8221\'d3 said Shel. \u8220\'d2The data is usually transmitted from her house in Waterloo, Ontario. She\rquote s got an implant behind her left retina, and she uses an external signal-processing device to correct the coding errors her retina makes so her brain can properly interpret the signals.\u8221\'d3\par \tab Analysts at other workstations were now listening in. \u8220\'d2So it\rquote s like she\rquote s transmitting everything she sees?\u8221\'d3 Tony asked.\par \tab Shel nodded.\par \tab \u8220\'d2Where are the signals being sent?\u8221\'d3\par \tab \u8220\'d2To the University of Tokyo, which is where the authors of that paper work.\u8221\'d3\par \tab \u8220\'d2But we can\rquote t view the images she\rquote s sending?\u8221\'d3\par \tab Shel displayed the hex dump once more. \u8220\'d2Not yet. We\rquote d need someone to write a program to render it in a computer-graphics format.\u8221\'d3\par \tab \u8220\'d2Are the algorithms in that journal article?\u8221\'d3\par \tab \u8220\'d2Yes. They\rquote re wicked complex, but they\rquote re there.\u8221\'d3\par \tab Tony frowned. It was interesting from a technical point of view, certainly, but there was no obvious security threat. \u8220\'d2Maybe if somebody in Donnelly\rquote s group has time, but\~...\u8221\'d3\par \tab \u8220\'d2No, no, that\rquote s not all, Tony.

The younger man went on: \u8220\'d2The intercepted data just disappears, and the data being sent to the girl sort of\~... }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid13851710 materializes}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid13851710  out of thin air.\u8221\'d3\par \tab Tony felt his eyebrows go up. He knew better than to say, \u8220\'d2That\rquote s impossible.\u8221\'d3 The Internet was a complex system of systems, with many emergent properties and unexpected quirks\emdash not to mention all sorts of entities trying to do things clandestinely with it. If there were data being manipulated on the Web in a way Shelton Halleck couldn\rquote t fathom, that was of real concern.\par \tab \u8220\'d2The kid is how old?\u8221\'d3 Tony asked.\par \tab \u8220\'d2Just about to turn sixteen.\u8221\'d3\par \tab He spread his arms. \u8220\'d2What strategic significance could there be in things a sixteen-year-old looks at? Stuff at the mall, rock videos?\u8221\'d3\par \tab Shel lifted his serpent-covered arm. \u8220\'d2That\rquote s what I thought, too. So I nosed around. Turns out her father is a physicist.\u8221\'d3 He brought up a Wikipedia page; the typically god-awful Wikipedia photo showed a horse-faced white man in his mid-forties.\par \tab \u8220\'d2Malcolm Decter,\u8221\'d3 said Tony, impressed. \u8220\'d2Quantum gravity, right? He\rquote s at the University of Texas, isn\rquote t he?\u8221\'d3\par \tab \u8220\'d2Not anymore,\u8221\'d3 said Shel. \u8220\'d2He moved in June to the Perimeter Institute.\u8221\'d3\par \tab Tony blew out air. People like himself and Malcolm Decter\emdash the mathematically gifted\emdash had three career options. They could go into academia, as Decter had, and while away their days pondering cosmology or number theory or whatever. They could go into the private sector, and become cube monkeys coding games at EA or hacking together cutesy user interfaces at Microsoft. Or they could go into intelligence, and try to change the world.\par \tab Tony looked briefly at the analysts hunched over their consoles, faces intent on glowing screens, reflections of the data visible in the eyeglasses most of them wore. What the hell difference did it make whether brane theory or loop quantum gravity was right or wrong if terrorists or a foreign power started something that ended with the world blowing itself up?\par \tab But\emdash the Perimeter Institute! Yes, yes, there was a part of Tony that envied those who had taken that path and had ended up there: the world\rquote s leading pure-science physics think tank. WATCH had tried to lure Stephen Hawking to come work for them.
